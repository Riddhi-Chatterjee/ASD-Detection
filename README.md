# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a system to detect **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** by analyzing how well subjects understand and follow verbal instructions. The system leverages cutting-edge AI and computer vision technologies to facilitate early detection and improve outcomes for individuals with ASD.

## Motivation
Autism Spectrum Disorder affects over **75 million people worldwide**, and early detection is critical to ensuring timely interventions that can significantly improve quality of life. This project aims to create an innovative and inclusive approach to diagnosis by automating task assignments, verbal communication through avatars, and performance analysis of subjects.

## Key Features
- **Task Assignment:** Automatically decides a set of tasks for the subject.
- **Verbal Communication:** Uses an avatar to verbally communicate instructions to the subject.
- **Performance Analysis:** Analyzes the subject's performance in following the instructions to detect ASD markers.

## Project Goals
- Aid in **early detection** of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
- Improve **intervention outcomes** for individuals with ASD.
- Reduce **long-term costs** associated with delayed diagnosis.
- Enhance the **quality of life** through **inclusive methodologies** that adapt to individual needs.

## Why This Matters
Early detection of ASD allows for interventions at a younger age, which significantly improves the developmental outcomes for individuals on the spectrum. This project provides a comprehensive and AI-driven solution, contributing to a **more inclusive future** for people with ASD.
